# Configuration Management (CM)

In this project, I started working with Puppet as a configuration management tool. I practiced writing Puppet manifest files to create a file, install a package, and execute a command.

## files in the directory

| Filenames              | Descriptions                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0-create_a_file.pp     | `Puppet`manifest that create file                      |
| 1-install_a_package.pp | `Puppet`manifest that install flask from pip3          |
| 2-execute_a_command.pp | `Puppet` manifest that kills a process named killmenow |
